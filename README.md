# BookingWizzard

## Project: hotel booking and management systems based on ASP.NET MVC

Main goals:
1. Viewing a list of hotels: Users should be able to view a list of available hotels, including their name, short description, and image.
2. Hotel Search: Search functionality for hotels based on various criteria such as location, price, star rating and availability.
3. View hotel information: Users can view detailed information about the hotel, including description, photos, list of available rooms and services provided.
4. Room Reservation: Allow the user to select the desired hotel room and book it for specific dates. Turn on the functionality of checking the availability of rooms and accounting for free places.
5. Managing Bookings: Users should be able to view their existing bookings, edit them (if allowed), cancel bookings, and view confirmations.
6. Authentication and Authorization : Authentication and authorization system to enable users to register, log in and have access to the booking functionality. Administrators must have additional access rights to manage data and bookings.
7. Admin Panel: Create an admin panel where admins can manage hotel, room and booking details. They should be able to add, edit and delete hotels and rooms, as well as view and manage existing bookings.
9. Reports and analytics: Implement reporting and analytics functionality so that administrators can view statistics on bookings, hotel popularity, revenue and other indicators.
